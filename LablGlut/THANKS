                                THANKS TO

- Jeffrey Palmer for contributing the nehe demo ports
- Mark Kilgard for creating GLUT
- Jacques Garrigue for writing LablGL
- Markus Mottl for writing OCamlMakefile
- Hugues Casse for writing FrontC, the basis for the program c2ml 
  included with LablGLUT.  This program was very helpful in porting the
  original GLUT demos written in C.
- Xavier Leroy for writing Camlidl, a wrapper generator for OCaml.  
  LablGLUT comes with a modified version of Camlidl that can handle 
  [bigarray,in] void* arguments, as well as arrays of GLdoubles and GLfloats.
  Camlidl was used to write LablGLUT's simplified bindings for GL and GLU.
- The OCaml team
