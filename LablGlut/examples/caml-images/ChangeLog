	* main.ml:
	Added a check so we don't do the expensive rescale unless we have to.

	* main.ml: Fixed up the aspect ratio.

	* main.ml:
	Added rescaling to next highest power of two along each axis.
	Changed texture coordinates so the image no longer appears rotated by 90 deg.

	* main.ml:
	Added conversion from camlimages to lablGL's preferred raw format.
	In order to make the image a power of two, I truncate the image.
	This needs to be replaced with scaling up to the next largest power of
	two and rescaling the square to have the proper aspect ratio.

	* .Makefile.swp: .

	* .Makefile.swp, Makefile, OCamlMakefile, main.ml:
	Just displays a checkerboard at the moment.
